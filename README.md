### TODO list

1. Standardise images used for training (size, location, etc.)
1. Research other methods for style transfer (what can CoreML do, etc.)
1. Add Sagemaker config to CycleGAN
1. Make sure CycleGAN is Python 3.x and Pytorch 1.x compatible!
1. Read the research paper to understand how it works!

Consider:

1. Taking a set of pictures from Manchester during day and night 
(this would prove to be an interesting art piece anyway!)
